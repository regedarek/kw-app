# Kamal secrets - common (shared across environments)
# 
# NOTE: Common secrets (like Docker registry credentials) are now fetched
# directly in each environment-specific secrets file (.kamal/secrets.staging, etc.)
# This file is kept for compatibility but is no longer used.
#
# See .kamal/secrets.staging or .kamal/secrets.production for the new pattern.
